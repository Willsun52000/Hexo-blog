AWS是亚马逊公司开发的云计算服务，包括计算服务EC2，对象存储服务S3，关系数据库服务RDS等。由于AWS在整个行业的领先位置，学习AWS的云计算并通过认证无疑是了解整个云计算公有云服务特点的最佳选择。根据本人最近学习备考的经历，总结最后查漏补缺的模拟题，希望能够给同样计划备考AWS认证的同学提供些许帮助。

You are working for a startup company that is building an application that receives large amounts of data. Unfortunately, current funding has left the startup short on cash, unable to afford thousands of dollars of storage hardware. The company has opted to use AWS. Which services would you implement to store a virtually unlimited amount of data without any effort to scale when demand unexpectedly increases? <br>
<strong>Choose the correct answer:</strong></p>

<div class="checklist"><div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"> Amazon S3, because it provides unlimited amounts of storage data, scales automatically, is highly available, and durable</div><div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox"> Amazon EC2, because EBS volumes can scale to hold any amount of data and, when used with Auto Scaling, can be designed for fault tolerance and high availability</div><div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox"> Amazon Import/Export, because Amazon assists in migrating large amounts of data to Amazon S3</div><div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox"> Amazon Glacier, to keep costs low for storage and scale infinitely</div></div></div></body></html>
